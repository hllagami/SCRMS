# SCRMS - Heidi Llagami
Repository dedicated for CEN302- Software Engineering Project @ Epoka University

The objective of this Software Engineering project is to effectively apply our acquired knowledge as students to tackle an identified problem, and subsequently resolve this problem by developing a software solution.​
The identified problem for this project was conducted by a needs analysis, which found that the current systems in Albania are inadequate in managing customer data and providing personalized communication. 
  
Identified Problem: Companies struggle to keep track of customer interactions, track sales leads, and maintain relationships due to the limitations of their current CRM system.  
  
Identified Solution: The purpose of SCRMS is to provide a prototype version of a software to improve the customer experience, streamline the sales process, and enhance the overall efficiency of customer relationship management between Albanian companies and their clients.​

## User Requirements 
* A Registration and Sign-In function for guests, users, and staff.  
* A display of customer interactions and purchase history.  
* An overview of customer data, lead contacts, and performance metrics.
* Features to add, update, and delete their business' information and contact leads.
* Overall, it's important to ensure that the software is user-friendly and intuitive, so users can easily navigate and use all of its features.  
    
## Application Specifications
The product scope of this web-based application includes a profile page, customer profile page, lead management, dashboard, and automated communication.  
* The application will contain a Login and Signup feature. Each user and company will have their own separate sets of data, such as leads, contacts, and sales.
* The profile page will allow the user to view and update their personal data.
* The lead management page will allow the user to view, search, update, and delete their contacts and contact leads.
* The customer profile page will contain personal data regarding to their customers' purchases, all relating to the user.
* The dashboard page will provide the user with graphical and calculated results of their sales.
* The automated communication feature will allow businesses to send personalized messages, emails, and offers to customers based on their behavior and preferences. This feature has yet to be implemented and is part of the software evolution.

## Project Implementation
The programming language used for this software project is PHP, followed by features of HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.  
To be able to access this application and host it locally, open-source web server solution packages such as the XAMPP Control Panel should be installed and activated.  After downloading the files from the GitHub repository, the files should be placed in the correct order inside the 'xampp'->'htdocs' folder found in the PC that will run the application.  
The application then can run after placing the following code in any browser URL:  http://localhost/SCRMS/index.php  

## Software Evolution
Due to time constraints, several features have not been fully implemented.  
The dashboard sections require additional development to reach completion. This will require more time to implement the formulas into the appropriate files, and the creation of additional tables for the database.
The Lead Management and Sales Metrics have yet to be developed, and may undergo changes as the application nears its completion.  
Furthermore, the automated communication feature, which enables businesses to send customized messages, emails, and offers to customers based on their behavior and preferences, is still awaiting implementation.  
Additionally, the Graphical User Interface may require more improvement and features in the future, such as color customization, light and dark mode, and more.
