All roles and tasks for this project will be applied by myself, to later on use this project as my graduation project.

### Identified Problem:
Based on a needs analysis of companies' customer relationship management (CRM) system, it has been identified that the current system is inadequate in managing customer data and providing personalized communication. Companies struggle to keep track of customer interactions, track sales leads, and maintain customer relationships due to the limitations of their current CRM system.

### Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, a CRM software application can be designed and developed to improve the customer experience, streamline the sales process, and enhance the overall efficiency of customer relationship management. The software should aim to provide a centralized platform for managing customer data, tracking customer interactions, and automating communication to improve customer engagement.

### Objectives:
* To provide a centralized platform for managing customer data, including contact information, purchase history, and customer preferences.
* To track and analyze customer interactions, including email communications, phone calls, and social media interactions.
* To automate communication with customers through email campaigns, targeted messaging, and personalized offers.
* To streamline the sales process by tracking sales leads, managing sales pipelines, and providing real-time reporting on sales performance.
* To improve customer engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized experiences and tailored communication.

### Description:
The CRM software will be designed as a web-based application that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. The software will feature a dashboard that displays customer data, sales leads, and performance metrics in real-time. The software will also include a customer profile page that displays customer interactions, purchase history, and customer preferences.  
  
The CRM software will automate communication with customers through email campaigns, targeted messaging, and personalized offers. The software will use machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and provide personalized recommendations based on customer preferences and behavior.  
  
The software will streamline the sales process by tracking sales leads, managing sales pipelines, and providing real-time reporting on sales performance. The software will also feature a mobile application that allows sales representatives to access customer data and sales leads on the go.
