# System Modeling for SCRMS

System modeling of a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software typically involves identifying the various components of the system and their relationships with one another. The following are some of the key components that may be involved:

* Login Management: This includes the management of users, such as their authorizations, password, email, and other personal information.
* Customer data: This includes information about customers, such as their contact details, purchasing history, preferences, and demographics.
* Sales process: This includes the steps involved in the sales process, from lead generation to closing deals.
* Marketing automation: This involves automating marketing processes such as lead nurturing, email campaigns, and social media outreach.
* Customer service: This includes the processes involved in providing customer service and support, such as ticket management, knowledge base management, etc.
* Analytics: This involves tracking and analyzing customer data and behavior to improve sales and marketing efforts.
* Integration: This involves integrating the CRM software with other systems, such as accounting software, inventory management software, and ecommerce platforms.

The System Models I have decided to work on for the SCRMS project consists of:  

* Context Models:  A definition of how context data is structured and maintained, by using various systems or databases.  
* Use Case Diagram:  A summarization of the users' possible interactions with the software.  
* Sequence Diagram:  A descriptive diagram explaining how, and in what order, a group of objects work together within the software.
